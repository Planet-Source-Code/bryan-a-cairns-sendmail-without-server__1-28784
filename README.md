### Description

Send emails without having to have a mail server.

<br>

Forgive me if you think this demonstration is pathetic...

This is really intended for beginners, and I know there are some out there

asking how to do this.

<br>

If you use any of this code, please give them credit.

<br>

This is just a simple program that shows how to send an email

without having an email server at your disposal.

<br>

To use, simply enter the Mail From, From Name, Mail To, and Subject, and Message.

<br>

How does this work?

Simple - it first takes the domain from the email you are sending to...

So if you are sending to a@b.com the domain is b.com

<br>

It then does an MX Lookup to find the mail server for that domain (mail.b.com)

Then it sends the email to the server.

<br>
 
### More Info
 
Lots of losers will build email flooding programs from this.
